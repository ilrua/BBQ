1. What is "BBQ"

BBQ is a extension of bilibili.It can makes bilibili easy.

2. Why your code like a sh*t

I dont kown what is JS(abababa)

3. Why the extension is .zip(OR .rar)

First.Im Chinese.An error will occur if it is loaded in the .crx format.（The app does not come from the Goooooooogle app store）。If I want to take it in the Gooooooogle app store, I need Over the Great Firewall.I cant do it.

4. Why are there so few functions, even some functions are not available

Fewer features are first because I don’t know how to write JS. Some function cannot be used because the update of bilibili is too fast.

5. Does it support other browsers (except Chrome)

Browsers that support some Chrome kernels. (Such as Edge-Chrome, Chrome(?) [The browsers listed here may not support this extension]) In short, I don't know.
(Chrome and Chrome kernel Edge can be used)

6. Why is it called BBQ

Don't you like barbecue?
